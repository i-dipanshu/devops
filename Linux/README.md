# Linux

Linux is a free open source operating system.

## Basic info

- **Operating system:** intermediary between the applications and the hardware running on your local machine.

    An OS can have GUI or not but usually servers don't have it.

- **KERNEL:** System software which takes command from us and gets the hardware to do it. 

    The `variation in kernel is distro` like ubuntu, fidora and many others

- **GNU:** extensive collection of free software that can be used as operating System


## File System
-  `/home` - contains the files related to user and user itself.
- `/bin` - contains all the command binaries like `cat, echo etc`
- `/sbin` - contains system binaries and needs `sudo`
